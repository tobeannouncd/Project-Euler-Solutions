# Project Euler Solutions
I am currently working through the backlog of Project Euler problems. I am working solely in Python 3. Occasionally, I may stream myself working through problems at http://www.twitch.tv/tobeannouncd

If you want to add me as a friend, use the method for creating a cypher as described in Project Euler problem 59 with an encryption key of "tobeannouncd" (minus the quotes). The cypher is a comma-separated series of ASCII values stored in friend_code_cypher.txt in the repo.
